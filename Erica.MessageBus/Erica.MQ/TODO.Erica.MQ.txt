* Add Oauth to FileManager 

* Find a way to expose documentation of the rest calls and the hub method calls so that clients don't need to look at the code. Maybe Swagger ?

* Create a simple UWP UI to act as a client app.

* Add Oauth to the User Interface Client and move Oauth secrets into a key vault
