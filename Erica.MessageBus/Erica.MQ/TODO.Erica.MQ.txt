* Modularize all repeated code like the HttpResponseMessage task, and the response.Content tasks into functions 

* Add Oauth to FileManager

* Do a sweep for formatting and other clean up

* Find a way to expose documentation of the rest calls and the hub method calls so that clients don't need to look at the code. Maybe Swagger ?

* Create a simple UWP UI to act as a client app.
